                  <p>We created feature.fm because we believe that every artist deserves to have their music heard by the right audience.</p>
                  <p>While experiencing how the music industry is changing and the struggles that artists go through, we set out to create something special that harmonizes with how music is experienced today. </p>
                  <p>After creating a playlisting service as a fun side project, Lior Aharoni teamed up with his brother, Zohar, to create a social streaming service that allows people to listen to streaming radio stations powered by their friends’ music tastes. They knew that streaming services are the future of where people will consume music and where recorded music revenue will come from. Lior planned to head to the US for 3 weeks to find investors. Years later, he is still managing the company out of New York.</p>
                  <p>After experiencing many of the common challenges that streaming services face and realizing that many artists struggle with getting their music heard, they decided that needed to help artists promote music within their streaming service. Then they had an “aha moment” and asked themselves,  “Why stop there? Why don’t artists have access to promote their music inside of streaming services in the first place? We can help artists get their music heard in all of the existing streaming services that people already use to consume music.”</p>

                  <p><strong>Feature.fm was born with these pricinples:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Every artist should have fair access to airplay in front of the right audience</li>
                    <li>Artists with great music deserve to be discovered</li>
                    <li>Artists should be able to make a living off of their music</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>As we continue to build feature.fm, we are committed to working together with artists to develop our vision based on their needs.</p>

                  <h2>Our Technology</h2>
                  <p>feature.fm’s best in class technology is the result of 3 years of development by a team of experts who specialize in big data analytics, content discovery and recommendation. Our sophisticated recommendation algorithms play the right song to the right people at the right time. Our data analytics provide deep insights to help artists make better decisions like never before.</p>
                  <p>feature.fm is the only platform that strengthens everybody who music touches in one holistic solution.</p>

    							<h3><strong>Music is made to be heard.</strong></h3>
                  <p>Musicians are artists who put their heart and soul into creating great music. However, once it’s created, they often have limited resources to bring it to market. When they do, they face the challenge of actually getting their music heard.</p>
                  <p>Easy distribution allows any artist to get their music into streaming services. But if you’re one of 30 millions songs and no one knows about you, how do you get your music heard?</p>

                  <h3><strong>The power of radio hasn't changed. But the way people listen to it has.</strong></h3>
                  <p>Radio has always been king when it comes to breaking a new artist or getting exposure. The reason for this is that it’s a great place to reach a mass audience and is also the one time that people give up control over the music they are listening to, making it extremely powerful for music discovery. Most artists, however, will never be able to get their music played on terrestrial radio.</p>
                  <p>The power of radio hasn’t changed, but the way people listen to the radio has. Now that people are transitioning into streaming services, it opens up a powerfully new platform to reach listeners.</p>
                  <h3><strong>Music lives in streaming services. Open them up to all artists for promotion.</strong></h3>
                  <p>Streaming services are where fans consume music and where music lives. It is the future of where recorded music revenue will come from. But artists are forced to promote their music outside of the streaming services, often turning to digital ad platforms that are not built for music, don’t guarantee exposure, and are very expensive.</p>

                  <h3><strong>The best way to promote a song is to play it to people.</strong></h3>
                  <p>The best way to promote a song is to play it to people and the best place to promote a song is where people listen to it.  Music is not a product with a value that can be explained. Music is emotional and the value of music needs to be experienced by people.</p>

                  <h3><strong>Artists deserve transparency.</strong></h3>
                  <p>Information is the basis for all decisions and it’s difficult for artists to get meaningful data into their listeners. We want to provide artists with real insight into their audience and how people genuinely respond to their music. We believe that understanding your audience allows you to make better decisions about how to further develop and market your music.</p>

                  <h3><strong>The money for music must come from fans.</strong></h3>
                  <p>We created feature.fm to give artists the best way to promote their music. After working with thousands of artists since our launch, we noticed that many artists still have little to no marketing budget to promote their songs. We wanted to provide a solution to these artists as well. We realized that at the end of the day, the money for music needs to come from fans.  In a world that every song is at your fingertips, fans now choose to support and pay for the music they love in new ways. We decided to create something that fits the way consumers behave rather than the way we want them to behave.</p>
